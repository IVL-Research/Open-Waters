# Tutorial to use TSC
This is a tutorial to be able to start using the TimeSeriesConstrictor package.
Data is included in the file "turb_data.xlsx"

## Installing Anaconda & Python
To be able to run the file TSC_tutorial.ipynb (which is a Jupyter Notebook file), Python is required.
To install Python, the package handler Anaconda is recommended. Follow the steps here below to get started.
1. [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install it.
2. If not done already, clone this repository (Git clone https://github.com/IVL-Research/Open-Waters.git). If you are not familiar with Git, I recommend downloading GitHub for desktop and using it to clone this repository.
3. Start "Jupyter Notebook". Windows: press windows button and search for Jupyter Notebook
4. A new window will be opened in your browser where you can see your file directory. Click your way to the TSC/Tutorial folder and open the TSC_tutorial.ipynb. 
5. Keep following the instructions written inside the notebook. It is code written in blocks which you can run one by one by marking one of the grey blocks and pressing Run at the top.
6. If you don't have the packages needed in the first cell of the notebook, it will cause an error. It can be fixed by opening "Anaconda prompt" (a terminal window) and writing "conda install plotly" - if the missing package is plotly.
